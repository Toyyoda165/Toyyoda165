- âš¡ Fun fact: I built my first computer at the age of 12 and have loved computers and tech since then. Unfortunatly I got a job in constuction and got stuck there for 16 years. At the age of 36 I have finally decided to make the switch to the tech world. The decision was based on wanting to do something I love and just plain tired of hurting and do not want to retire in a wheelchair.

- I have obtained a Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp.org and the Google Cyber Security Professional certificate.
- I have been slowly learning Python for the past 2 years and have been using Linux for the past 4 years. I love Linux.
- I love learning and I am eager to land a job that gives me many more avenues to learn and grow.
